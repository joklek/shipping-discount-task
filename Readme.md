To run this program you will need at least Java 16.

First you'll have to run `build-shipping-discount-calculator` and then you can run `run-shipping-discount-calculator` as
many times as you want.

If you `run-shipping-discount-calculator` without arguments, it will take the file contents in `input.txt` in your main
directory. Otherwise, you can enter a second argument as the filepath to your input file.

## Questions

* Is it guaranteed that the shipping lines will be provided ordered by date
* Should the parser be strict about whitespaces?
